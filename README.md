    ```
    http://localhost:3060/login
    ```
- Set the request as a POST

- In the body section, set it as a JSON format and paste the credentials >
    ```
    {
        "username": "admin",
        "password": "admin"
    }
    ``` 
- `This will generate a token that is required to do a request`

### GETS

#### GET BY ID
- Open a new tab
- Paste the url in the request
`http://localhost:3060/byId?id=tt0031387`
    - You can use this id for a test> `tt0031387`
- Make sure the request to be GET
- Click on Send

- Paste the url in the request
`localhost:3060/search?value=gorilla`

- To search by page add the params `&page=#` as a example you can use>
